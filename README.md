# AI Model Packaging Library

## Overview

This repository contains the **AI Model Packaging Library**, developed as part of the **Capstone Project (Milestone 5) for the Master of Science in Software Engineering** at **Grand Canyon University (GCU)**.
The project delivers a **command-line interface (CLI) tool** that automates the process of packaging machine learning models into deployable **Docker containers**â€”eliminating the need for manual containerization and DevOps expertise.

---

## Project Purpose

The AI Model Packaging Library addresses a **common challenge in machine learning workflows**: deploying trained models into production.
Traditionally, this requires:

* Manual creation of Dockerfiles
* Dependency management for different frameworks
* Model and inference script integration
* Knowledge of Docker, containerization, and DevOps pipelines

This tool solves those problems by offering a **single command** that packages any supported ML model into a fully deployable Docker image.

---

## Key Features

* **Model Auto-Detection**: Supports **PyTorch (.pth)** and **TensorFlow (.h5)** formats.
* **Automated Dockerization**: Generates Dockerfile, installs dependencies, and packages the model.
* **Zero Docker Expertise Required**: Ideal for data scientists unfamiliar with containerization.
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux with Docker installed.
* **Production-Ready Images**: Includes inference script and sample input for testing.
* **Error Handling & Fallbacks**: Gracefully handles build failures and provides troubleshooting guidance.

## ðŸ›  Installation & Setup

### **1. Clone Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-model-packaging-library.git
cd ai-model-packaging-library
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**

Make sure you have Python 3.9+ and Docker installed.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3. Generate a Sample Model**

```bash
python models/gen_real_model.py
```

### **4. Package the Model into a Docker Image**

```bash
python cli.py --input resnet18_full.pth --image my_ai_model:1.0
```

### **5. Run Inference Inside the Container**

```bash
docker run --rm my_ai_model:1.0
```

## ðŸ“Š Example Output

**Building Docker Image**

```
SUCCESS: Built Docker image: my_ai_model:1.0
```

**Running Inference**

```
Processing image: sample.jpg
Top 5 predictions:
   1. Class 741: 7.2%
   2. Class 539: 5.1%
   3. Class 735: 4.3%
```

## Security Considerations

* Uses **end-to-end Docker container isolation**.
* All dependencies installed from trusted package sources.
* Encourages use of **private container registries** for sensitive models.
